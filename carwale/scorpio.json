Driver seat Not for wide people. I thought Scorpio is made for large built people, but it is not. Back side look very disappointing 3rd row seat. Why 2nd row not sliding to give more space to third row? Why 3rd row is not 50:50 split? And if we have back door sideway open with door handle inside, then why not jump seats provided?
