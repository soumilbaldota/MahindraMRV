In the new version back door with windows would have been best for family use. Not satisfied with this version", "New Thar is a perfect off-roader available in Indian market. Both Petrol and Diesel vehicles are state of the art. Mahindra could have priced it between 9 to 11L for better reach as it is going to be parked in buyers garage as an option. Obvious reasons are: 1. 3 doors not convenient for family specifically for aged if you have to occupy rear seats. 2. Hand Rest for rear passengers are missing. 3. Glasses are fixed so if engine is switched off rear passengers would be in problem. 4. Very less boot space. Makes it fit for 2 not for 4. 5. Roof of the upper end is made with fiber. It appears huge compromise, looking into the price. Mahindra has definitely worked hard and made it a dream 'Off Roader', but to make it a compulsory choice above has to be looked seriously, else I could have had it!", "I bought new 2020 Thar diesel variant. which was about 7048 km driven, some shocker noise is coming from rear side. today it's ac was not working, it was repaired by company goodwill after request.", "Good car but 4 seater hai or thodi mehangi hai itne price me humare pass isse much better option hai.

Of course it's not agile but I was able to do some steep overtakes at 80( not advised at all. Please be safe!) Looks amazing. I have 4 other cars and no one has stopped me to ask about them. Thar just demands attention. Seating is comfortable, back cushions could have been better Oh yes dashboard storage space is negligible. I could only put toll receipts. Storage spaces are lacking.

Ride quality cannot be compared to sedan but then its a high riding suv. Initially was bit uncomfortable but as time goes will start loving the Thar . suspension is sort of stiff at times . I currently have no problem in cruising at 130 kmph .The car is stable at that speed . Couldn't feel the body roll most people complain about .

The car definitely has the looks, every the fuel station guy would smile and asked me few questions. The power is in the petrol version is awesome, you can feel the burst of energy and speed. Mileage is not great expect 9 km/l anything beyond that is a bonus. The front cabin is cool with lots of features on the dash and the seats are comfortable too. Back space is suited for two, not that comfortable. Boot space is fit for midget luggage's. Mahindra should address this problem.

Rear seat should have adjustable cup holders at the middle of seat as in SUV 300. This two things should be added by Mahindra in the upcoming versions of Thar.

We own cars starting from Fortuner, Octavia, rapid, i20 and old Thar but my new Thar is simply awesome it gives more value than our other vehicle's. I have never seen people clicking photos of Octavia or Fortuner but this vehicle gives you complete value. Things which I like the most: 1. Value proposition 2. Road presence 3. Highly capable off-roader 4. Engine refinement 5. Safety 6. Looks Things which I don't like 1. Build quality 2. Halogen headlight 3. Underbody paint 4. Reverse camera The issues I have mentioned are minor things however I I'll be very happy if Mahindra pay more attention to quality instead of promotion. Secondly headlight is a serious problem because it cause nuisance to others, a projector lights can solve the problem but Mahindra don't care.

It gives you that feel of a big suv, seating is comfortable however luggage space is a luxury. Compared to old Thar this is a huge improvement. Road presence is amazing Not done much off-roading but recently pulled one Eicher-Volvo truck. Cons: Build quality is not up to the mark, please get a good underbody paint job done at the earliest. Plastic quality is ok Conclusion: It is not my Thar it is our Thar, specially 8 years old son loves it even more than me. It is an experience worth having.

I liked that so I got this. When I test drove it, I felt the power of Thar so tough, it can't be explained in words. In my neighborhood a man of 25 has bought 8 month old Thar and modified it with very heavy tyres, headlight, sound system and other things. The thar looks like a monster in my locality. Thanks to Anand Mahindra and his group for his focus on such sub compact SUV. It has a great engine and there you get approx. 12 km/l mileage that is good for such sports cars hungry for fuel.

I have take my beast to the narrowest roads of Himachal to dirtiest trails of river beds and its just simply wow, Have pushed the acceleration to 160km without any hassle. The engine doesn't cry to stop but instead it demands to be pushed beyond its capabilities. The low luggage capacity, wind noise above 100 km are itsy bitsy things which are or can be ignored because off what Mahindra is providing its totally a different category/segment which can be compared with.
