Superbly packaged, classy and extremely comfortable - including such bits as the ventilated seats (front only) & high quality of finish. The sheer range of equipment provided is far ahead of the competition. I bought this SUV in end March 2019. It helped that the sales personnel knew all the tech details that we queried them about. Good experience. In fact the sales team kept in touch even after the purchase. Recently, we drove from Indore to Mumbai and back - short holiday. A minimum of 12 plus kmpl on the highway and the vehicle handled beautifully - none of us who took turns to drive felt any tiredness at the end of the journey. Smooth and silent we were surprised that the engine spun at 1500 rpm at 100 kph! And we had loaded it up with 4 suitcases plus an assortment of carry on bags, etc. No problem. Plenty of space at the rear. The 1000 km servicing before our trip was efficiently done - basic checks, tightening of nuts and bolts & washing. The entire vehicle appears to be imported.
