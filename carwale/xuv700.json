It's my first time driving a Indian car, all my life I've been driving Volkswagen and Skoda. And let me to you the build quality is pathetic. The doors are so hollow and light weight. The doors on my Polo is much stronger. Cars like T roc are much much better in terms of build quality. XUV 700 is just for people who need a car which has diesel engine and is big and bulky doesn't matter even if it's made of cardboard. Very disappointed with what Mahindra has done. I'm not someone who goes for the long list of unnecessary features when they've compromised on the build quality and driving dynamics. Yes it may touch 200 km/h but on bumpy Indian roads I'm very sure it's going to have loads of body roll ( based on my test drive ). I don't want to risk my family's life with this car.

Engine options and power delivery seems great.Not sure about some ADAS features on Indian road, conditions like lane keep assist and automatic emergency braking can keep these features switched off. Mahindra has packed all the available features of a luxury car but once you are inside you can feel the low quality plastic and cheap and nasty finishings except the seats.Touch Screen was not very much responsive.You can't slide the 2nd row seats back. Piano black glossy inside door handles are prone to get scratches.No auto dimming IRVM,Really Mahindra are you joking.Auto pop-up door handles are very fragile and probably won't last longer.

ADAS is buggy and dangerous,already some cars are replaced so that news does not get out,but do not expect they will replace for everyone. Initial software and electronic issues, will be a nightmare to get fixed 3rd row not the best in class, so not a true 7 seater Ride quality not best in class Waiting periods Conclusion: In short lower variants are better value for money, but this is not a classy looking or a butch looking car, rather looks on MUV side.

I have given a test drive for both Scorpio n and the xuv700. The car is such a good buy. I have booked the diesel manual luxury pack midnight Black xuv700. Scorpio n was good but xuv700 was a complete package I was looking for. From interiors the touchscreen the colour combination and the features have left behind other competitors on the market. The performance being the main subject is also the best in the segment. The suspension was so smooth and the power can be felt as soon as you step the gas pedal. Highly recommend the xuv700 diesel. The only cons is the fact that the delivery for the car is so delayed like it's almost 1 year.

Has a lot of pros. The Adrenox system has too many bugs though. But can be easily fixed by Mahindra via patches. The car looks significantly better in person than in pics. The engine is a gem. Slow speed ride over patched surfaces can be better. The ride is excellent at higher speeds. The interior looks really nice with the big screen and sun roof. Do note that all the plastics are hard plastics. The steering is nice and light at slow speeds and weighs up nicely as the speed increases. The seats are good and comfortable. The AC is adequate and cools the car well.", "The new XUV7OO is truly a phenomenal car that you can consider buying. The ride quality, comfort and performance are much better than you think that a Mahindra can offer. The technology used in the car is up-to-date. There are some features in this car like ADAS level 2 ,which are only available in limited premium cars, that cost a lot. The build quality of the car is great. Recently, the Global NCAP graded the car a 5-star safety rating, which is really impressive. If you are going to book a XUV7OO, know that you'll be having to wait for at least a year. This is due to the ongoing Global chip shortage.

Please launch black colour variants.", "An awesome overall package , great performance and affordable availability of ADAS. The dash is super futuristic and has all the bells and whistles you would expect at this price point . The overall fit and finish of the dash is at par . The panel gaps are fairly consistent . The adreno x super screen is very fluid and responsive . The digital instrument cluster is great however, to choose the driving modes, there is no dedicated button or knob and can only be accessed through the touchscreen, except a little punch from the zap mode the others are a little gimmicky. The glove box is decent sized and there are quite a few places to keep stuff in. They have however missed an electro chromic inside rear view mirror offered in much cheaper cars . The driver seats are electrically adjustable and the front seat offers great support . For the second row passenger , there is a boss button to increase the legroom , nifty touch . It pampers you with a lot of goodies like 360 parking aid , blind spot assist , dual zone hvac , and a humongous sky roof to name a few . The second row space is decent , the floor being flat , easy to accommodate three people . The third row space is fair enough , not suitable for adults above 5'5 for more than a short trip , but folding them increases the boot space by an awesome capacity . The boot space with the third row unfolded is just okay. Only to nitpick , one thing comes in my mind , that the AWD option is only offered with the top spec trim without the luxury pack , which would have you to choose between the extra goodies like the 360 parking aid , blind spot assist , sony 3d sound system , and an electric parking brake against the four wheel drive option ."], "5": ["2.

I applied leather seat covers to all seats and it was cheaper than my previous car. The only con is that if you're travelling far with more than 5 people,(one person has to sit in the third row with the luggage) it gets extremely uncomfortable. The last row seats aren't designed to be much comfortable and people of all heights will suffer. But, the car itself is really good especially the AdrenoX system and the built in Alexa .
