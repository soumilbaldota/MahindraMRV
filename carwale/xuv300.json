Took Test Drive twice before going for final decision as i was confused between Kia Seltos Diesel IMT & Mahindra XUV 300 Diesel AMT W8 (O). Price gap was almost 70K for on road price. Kia people was not ready to give single Rs. Discount as they have too much booking in hand. So I don't like this attitude. Moreover i liked XUV 300 also which comes with more features in less price than Seltos as I was planning to buy Top end model only. So finally I made decision to go with XUV 300 AMT Diesel W8 (O) Dual Tone. Car was available in stock and delivered within 15 days. (Here i was not looking for Dual tone, i want to buy White color XUV300 with new logo, but they said they have vehicle with old logo which i don't want. Then they informed me that Dual Tone (Red + White Top) available with new logo & i booked it. * If people have more budget up to 23 Lakhs, blindly go for Scorpio-N. It will really give you feel like King and you will forget about Safari, Fortuner, Endeavor. My budget was up to 17 Lakhs only so i choose XUV300 and i want AMT Only as i was fed up of clutch usage in traffic. Driving Experience:- 1} Request to all Indian Buyers. Please don't underestimate Mahindra. They have done lot of hard work while building the vehicle. Diesel Engine cabin noise is almost nil as they provided great insulation. 2} My Height is 5 Ft 11 inches. When i seat in driving seat and adjust the seat as per my comfort level, so in my rear row, any tall guy of almost same height can sit very comfortably. (This is because rear space has more legroom due to which boot space is less) 3} 5* Safety, Best Features with Hill Hold Control, TPMS, Sunroof, Cruise Control, 6 Airbags, Three point Seat Belt on rear sit and many more. 4} In Pune City mileage given between 15 to 15.8 Km/L ( My daily run is 50 KM in traffic) And if AMT vehicle giving you this mileage then what more you expect? 5} Driven car almost 2100 Km out of which 1000Km was highway drive. On Highway I got 20.9 Km/L mileage. Due to good roads i driven most of the vehicle on Cruise Control. 6} 1st Servicing is done at 1000 Km for all check up. Small vibration was coming from boot door which is then solved during servicing. Now vehicle is ready to go long long way. 7} Before making any judgment for Indian brand, first take test drive, look at the features they are providing, price, mileage, service cost, parts availability and most important Safety & Going for Indian brand which Indians don't want to go for only because they think only foreign brands like Kia, Hyundai are best. But these brands are nothing but all about Looks only. Safety Seltos, Sonet, Venue all are having 3 star ratings. For Pros their is long list but for Cons their is only one which is Boot Space. But 250 Litre Boot space is enough for my family of three as I don't carry luggage all the time. 3 Suitcase and backpacks can easily fit in this boot space.", "Good front looks Refined engine with less noise Spacious and comfortable seats But w8 diesel version seems to an expensive deal.

In the beginning I felt very strange noise and whole car is vibrating and i complained and they took nearly 1 week to rectify the problem. After done with 60000 kms the performance is decent not very good not very bad but the build quality is really very good and car body is very solid. This car gives me mileage of 13 to 15 at highway and around 12 to 13 in normal city driving which is little low but if you maintain 85 to 95 speed you may get 17 also. I big issue is that the Boot space is very small as compared to other cars which is the only major issue i found in the car overall the car is very comfortable while riding and service and maintenance cost is also low . At the end i would recommend this car to those who want fun driving with a good looking and safe car.", "Buying experience good, driving experience is excellent. Overall good. Excellent performance. I get 17.87 km/litter mileage. Suspension is like Elephant . Mileage is near to equal in city or highways approx.", "", "Car looks are good.

Driving Experience: The feel attached to the XUV most of the times, felt refreshed and joy on high gears. Details about looks, performance etc: Mine is a W6 variant with limited features. so I don't feel much appealing on the appearance, surely I like or would recommend W8 variant which is an impressive package. Servicing and Maintenance: I just completed 3k kms so regarding service its not fair to comment, i have given first free service which is a routine checkup. PROS: Confident inside outside Good road presence Spacious and good roomy nature best in compact SUV. Cabin space and vehicle performance is competitive to Creta and Seltos. If we drive average fuel efficiency in city shall be 15 to 17 km/l and on highways 19 to 21 km/l based upon road and driving conditions. Sunroof was impressive. When i checked from Tank to Tank mileage calculation I got 19 km/l which I feel decent with all times AC on. AC is good Cons: Boot space is less which is 257 liters. It's enough and based on the space management techniques we can adjust 5 people luggage with ease. Power lag is there at 1 & 2 gear during the bumper to bumper traffic. Head Lights throw should be more better, I personally feel loosing confidence while facing opposite vehicles few times.", "Good driving experienced with this car and infotainment system also very enjoyable and suffers in this car very comfortable, and speakers are very enjoyable and good economic feelings.", "I have recently booked the top end variant, but the dealer called me and told about the price hike now it has gone out of my budget.

I still remember the day I drove this lovely car to my home: I am sure my car attracted the attention of at least 30 people (40 km to my home from the showroom), including the traffic police. I realized that this was due to the fact that XUV3oo has good an imperial masculine look at the front, giving it an edge over its rivals in the market.

The treatment we received at its showroom in Thrissur was very amazing: the staff was very polite and offered the service we expected. Pros: Its boxy masculine look which gives a sheer road presence. Its seats are of high quality.

I bought top model W 8 variant with sunroof. The best features of this car is dual tone AC and sunroof with anti pinch feature. The other features like 17\" diamond cut alloy wheel and front and rear parking sensors which doesn't come in any other car. The rear camera with voice parking assistant is good for amateurs. The one feature I like most in this car is hybrid technology so that whenever your car stops at traffic signal and u put your car in neutral the engine stops which increase its fuel efficiency. It has hill assist Function and ABS with ESP to control the car smoothly. Even the console is best in class like other luxurious cars with mood changing colours.

The assosaries cost you bomb and fixing them too long a time spoling the enthusiasm to drive out new vehicle. I am writing this review after he first mandaory service and driving 2,000 KM in past 25 days since I am owning it. Looks wise it is stunning and the acquamarine colour is quite attractive. It being my fourth car in 20 years, I looked forward to some driving comfort, good safety features. I am fully satisfied with the passenger space, though the boot space has been compromised for that. Also if you are migrating from a Sedan like Honda Amaze you will feel the pinch. Now coming to the driving comfort, three modes of steering wheel makes very little difference. Driving on the highways is a sheer pleasure. Even at 140 KMPH the vehicle is stable and you do not feel the speed or no vibration is transferred into cabin. The leg space for the driver is very cramped, which should have been definitely wider for a comfortable seating and longer driving experience. You have very little scope to spread your legs or keep knees apart. You will forced to keep your leg on the clutch pedal or inconviniently below it. Now coming to the design, the worst experience for the driver is while turning to right - into a lane -- where you cannot see anything as the visibility is totally blocked by the large Rear View Mirror (its positioning) and very close to that is the front Pillar holding the windshield. These two together totally block your view. For a seasoned driver, it is Ok, but for a new driver it could be cause of concern. THE MAHINDRA XUV300 DESIGN TEAM needs to look into this aspect. The 185 mm ground clearance is worthwhile and larger wheelbase does provide it the stability and the infotainment is enjoyable as its quality is good. Some smaller features I am myself yet to get used to as some of them are complicated. KMs to empty tank that changes dynamically depending on the traffic and driving conditions, is very useful on highways. -- RAMESH SUSARLA", "Riding experience: I is wonderful product Smooth handling Features are grate\nDetails about looks, performance etc: It looks pretty good Luxurious\nPros and Cons: Boot space small Some what high in price", "Back seat pe ac vents nahi hai.is liye mai thoda dispoint hu or boot space b thoda kam hai.otherwise gaddi bhut achi hair.back ac vent mere liye ik important feature so i cant buy this suv.summer session me Gadi back seats ko jaldi cooling nahi de paiye gi.back seat pessenger passenger's ko grmi mein problem ho sakti hai.", "Riding experience: This car gives you the feel of a proper suv interiors are good exterior is perfect looking.

It's tyre direction feature is unique and really helps when you are taking your vehicle out in congested parking slots . Front sensors are also of great help while driving on congested roads.

A vehicle to brag upon. In country like India, SUVs are liked at the most. reason due to good performance, high ground clearance ,reliability and assurance. In sub four meter segment, xuv300 is overall a good package. 2. Space. space has been mahindra's forte. Believe me, its the maximum space offering sub four meter SUV. boot is rather decent size, not biggest of the class. 3. rich feel interior. best in class interior and quality is brilliant, nothing feels cheap at all (a lot of hard plastics though). 4. comfort. it is a comfortable car i would say, nothing much on that. its decent. 5. feature loaded. there are a lot of first in class features that make it a good choice. 6. decent under thigh support, head room and leg room. shoulder room on second row may be tight for three hunks. 7. Mileage. it returned an amazing mileage of 21kmpl. yeah that's right... CONS: 1. Good to drive, but nothing beats Ford. ecosport being its rival, is more fun to drive vehicle, with more performance and stability of ford doesn't need any praise. but when buying a vehicle, we look to whole package. so this point is on you, what you need. 2. boot space could be more. boot is an issue in this vehicle. if you plan a trip with 4/5 people with luggage, you might to cut down some luggage, or say good bye to one of your friends. (in our case, we declined one seat to increase load carrying capacity). 3. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION OFFERED IS AN AMT... how can you offer amt on an suv. amt is such a notchy transmission, that willl definitely give jerks post 3000 rpm. i haven't driven amt one, but amt is amt. mahindra should have offered AT as is the case with xuv500. if you are an enthusiasts driver who love to rev and get high end performance, its rival may make a good option, but if you want a fully loaded suv with space, comfort and overall strong performance, you should definitely go for this one.", "I like this car very much for Mahendra xuv 300 And very comfortable seats in the car.

But after my purchase this W8 petrol version and driving approx. 700 kg in last 15 days, I can say this is best car in its segment. It competes none other than Creta as has high comfort in driving, smooth clutch, smooth gear, excellent power and rich interior. Boot space and Back AC systems are the only weak point but it do not affect much. How many times in a year we require big boot space? In routine it is actually leg room space comfort for back passengers is more important. Ride of car is very smooth and it is loaded with a lot of features. AC is very strong so absence of back AC vents does not affect. Since engine is turbo booster hence in the beginning felt little awkward due to turbo lag and sudden speed pick up but later on got habitual. On mileage part very little was shared in previous reviews and I kept checking before my purchase so that I can decide on this but I want to help for those who are looking for purchase new car. On long run it gives 15Km/Lit fuel economy which is quite decent for this heavy weight car and it is with AC on. My regular run is a 15 km stretch and traffic can be said average only. Traffic area generally covers 2-3 Km and rest is not so much busy. Hence in the scenario I am getting approx. 13 - 13.5 Km /Lit mileage again in AC on condition but i am single occupant. I hope this will help to all. I am sure venue will not be able to match XUV-300. On the contrary, Creta lookers can go for this and save 2-3 lakh.", "buying experience was excellent, riding experience was very smooth, looks are killer, performance is very good, servicing is excellent. everything is good in dis car except space .the sunroof experience is mind blowing. the real seat shud have more space", "Superb compact suv..

Though prices difference was huge between both vehicle. the NVH level with the ease of driving around in city or at highway is just effortless. Second, main reason to choose one over the other was the backseat comfort. Both vehicles are same at back but Nexon seems spacious at back but the suspension of XUV300 does its magic to make ride comfortable at back seat for passenger. Also with its boxy design XUV suited more than Nexon for a 5'11 guy who is big.\nRiding experience: XUV300 clearly holds the trophy in this area. As noise cancellation is very good, one could hardly hear the road or engine sound. The overall visibility is great, in Nexon the A pillar is a big blind spot which needs to be worried about while driving in crowded area. Nexon disappoints with the engine and road noise coming in a lot.\nDetails about looks, performance etc: Both vehicles have their unique design. Nexon has much youthful vibe to it, XUV300 is more of a afford luxury compact SUV.\nServicing and maintenance: Have just both XUV300 so not much to say.

As usual being a new and high demand vehicle I didn't get any discount or complimentary from the showroom or for that matter from M &M. I almost drove this car for 600km within couple of days after purchase and I really amazed with its performance and pick up. Initially I have some doubts whether 1.2L engine will have that much claimed power and pick up. One can feel the safety and it's sturdiness while driving this car. Steering, clutch and break are well designed and very smooth, effortless to handle.One movement of time I thought of waiting for auto gear transmission (AMT) but after driving this car i have no regrets with manual transmission vehicle. Mileage also to my my surprise 15.6KM/L before first service. Trust me I really enjoyed its pick up and drive quality, I drove on the NH7 with full seating capacity with 100km/h, no jerks so stable. Being a petrol car no noise,and its a/c is also good enough in the hot summer (40degC). External looks are superb however internal things need some modifications especially white interiors are not so attractive moreover maintenance point of view also not a good choice.
